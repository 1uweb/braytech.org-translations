## Contributing translations manual

This a full manual for a completely newbie.

#### GitHub

1. First of all if you don't have a github account __create a github account__

2. You can't make changes directly to this repository, so you have to __fork it to your page__

3. You can edit translations online or mirror repo files to your PC. Second is preferred.

#### VS Code

4. There are different softwares used to work with git on PC, we recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as an all-in-one tool.

5. After installing and opening VSCode select **Clone repository**

6. Here you have an ability to auth your VS Code app with git account. Use it.

7. Then click on the repo name (it will be like yourGitAccountName/braytech.org-translations) and select thw folder on your PC where to save the repo files.

8. After loading the files VS Code will suggect you actions in right bottom angle on the app. Click "Open".

#### Git Graph

9. Here I advise you to install extention **Git Graph**. It will help you a lot to understand the flow of changes.
Click on "extentions" tab on left and search for `git graph` then click install.

10. Here you will have a new icon in explorer tab. Click on it.

11. You see the history on all changes to this repository. Who, when and the subject itself.

#### Configuring git

12. Now you need to configure git in order to make everything easy. Top right angle of git graph tab has a settings icon.

13. Two important areas here.

14. First of all **User Details**. 
You have to set your git account name so that other users can correlate your git account to your commits.
You may not set email if you want it to be private. If you do, anyone can see it.

15. Second, but very important. I advise you to add to **Remote Configuration** this repo (right now you have only your fork there). This will allow you to be aware of changes in parent repo. Use button "Add remote" and fill the "Fetch URL" filed with `https://github.com/justrealmilk/braytech.org-translations`
Also I advise you to rename remotes so that you can easily identify them. Use "Edit" button for that
